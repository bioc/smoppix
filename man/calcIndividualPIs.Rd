\arguments{
\item{p}{The point pattern}

\item{tabObs}{A table of observed gene frequencies}

\item{pis}{The probabilistic indices to be estimated}

\item{pSubLeft}{The subsampled overall point pattern}

\item{owins, centroids}{The list of windows corresponding to cells,
and their centroids}

\item{null}{A character vector, indicating how the null distribution is
defined. See details.}

\item{features}{A character vector, for which features should the
probabilistic indices be calculated?}

\item{ecdfAll, ecdfsCell}{Empirical cumulative distribution functions of all
events and of cells within the cell, under the null}

\item{loopFun}{The function to use to loop over the features.
Defaults to bplapply except when looping over features within cells}

\item{minDiff}{An integer, the minimum number of events from other genes
needed for calculation of background distribution of distances}

\item{minObsNN}{An integer, the minimum number of events before a gene is analysed before. See details.}
}
\value{
A list containing PI entries per feature
}
\description{
Calculate individual PI entries
}
\details{
For the single-feature nearest neighbour distances, the average
is already calculated
